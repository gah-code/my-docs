## Status Update: AI Initiative â€” **Week 3**

**Period covered:** \[MM/DD â†’ MM/DD]
**Owner:** \[Your Name] â€¢ **Project:** Internal AI Tool (AI Initiative)
**RAG:** **Scope** ðŸŸ¢ â€¢ **Schedule** ðŸŸ¡ (frontâ€‘loaded security work) â€¢ **Risk** ðŸŸ¡

### TL;DR

* **Foundation first:** Significant early effort went into **security, authorization, and authentication** for API and LLM access (SSO/OIDC, RBAC scopes, key/secret handling, audit). This **frontâ€‘loads risk reduction** and unblocks feature velocity.
* **Prototype running:** Initial endâ€‘toâ€‘end flow working behind feature flag; early prompts + response rendering; basic logging and guardrails in place.
* **Ready to accelerate features:** With access + controls stabilized, weâ€™ll focus on highâ€‘value use cases and usability in the next sprint.

**Note:** Early weeks emphasized **access, compliance, and platform readiness**, which naturally reduced visible feature velocity but deâ€‘risked the project.

## Whatâ€™s Done (Week 1 â†’ Week 3)

* âœ… **Access & Security**

  * Enforced **SSO/OIDC** login and **RBAC** roles; mapped scopes for read/write operations.
  * **Token lifecycle** (refresh/rotation) wired via gateway; **audit & request logging** enabled.
  * **Secret handling** centralized (no secrets committed; compatible with local OS keychain or vault).
* âœ… **LLM/Service Integration**

  * API client w/ **retry, backoff, and circuitâ€‘break** patterns; baseline **rateâ€‘limit** handling.
  * **Prompt/response pipeline** with PIIâ€‘redaction hooks and output safety filters (configurable).
* âœ… **Prototype UI/CLI**

  * Minimal flow to submit a prompt against a sandbox model and render response; **featureâ€‘flagged**.
* âœ… **Delivery Plumbing**

  * CI checks (lint/test), preview builds, environment promotion, and feature flag rollout process.
* âœ… **Documentation**

  * **Decision log (ADR)** for provider selection, access model, and logging standards.
  * Onboarding README: env setup, flags, test commands.

## New This Week (Week 3 Highlights)

* First **secure endâ€‘toâ€‘end demo** (login â†’ prompt â†’ response â†’ log).
* **Performance baseline** captured (latency, token usage) for later optimization.
* Drafted **useâ€‘case shortlist** with stakeholders; identified 1â€“2 candidates for a V1 slice.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Competing internal initiatives/hackathons** reduce maker time â†’ **Mitigation:** block **2Ã— 3â€‘hour focus windows**/week; align on which events are mandatory vs. optional.
* **Ambiguity on V1 useâ€‘case** risks rework â†’ **Mitigation:** pick a **single primary workflow** + success metric this week.
* **Model/provider limits** (rate, cost, data residency) â†’ **Mitigation:** perâ€‘env quotas, cost dashboards, optional fallbacks.
* **Prompt injection/data leakage** â†’ **Mitigation:** PII redaction, allowâ€‘list tools, response validators, and user education microcopy.

---

## Decisions Needed (Manager/Leadership)

1. **Confirm the primary V1 useâ€‘case** (choose one): \[Option A], \[Option B].
2. **Access to sample/staging data** for the chosen workflow (owner: \[Name], by \[Date]).
3. **Event load balance:** guidance on **which hackathons to prioritize** vs. skip next sprint.
4. **Privacy review slot** for logging/telemetry approach (by \[Date]).

---

## Plan: Next 2â€“3 Weeks

* **V1 Slice Build:** UX polish, error states, and success metric instrumentation for the chosen workflow.
* **Guardrails:** Expand PII detection, add unsafeâ€‘content handlers, finalize egress rules.
* **Telemetry & Cost:** Token/cost dashboards; latency SLOs; alerting on abnormal usage.
* **Beta Prep:** Pilot with \[Team X], feedback survey, and bug triage rubric.

**Target outcomes:**

* 1 measurable **workflow completed** (E2E)
* â‰¤ **N** sec median latency; **>X%** task completion in pilot
* Logging compliant; no **P0** security gaps

---

## Feedback to Leadership

* The **early time investment in auth/security** was essential; it **removed critical unknowns** and enables faster iteration now.
* To accelerate delivery: (a) confirm V1 useâ€‘case, (b) reduce nonâ€‘essential event load for two sprints, (c) provide stable staging data.

### (Optional) Slackâ€‘sized Summary

> **AI Tool â€” Week 3:** Secure E2E prototype live (login â†’ prompt â†’ response). Early weeks were heavy on **auth/LLM access + audit** to deâ€‘risk. Need decision on **single V1 useâ€‘case** and guidance on hackathon participation to protect focus time. Next: ship V1 slice to pilot, add guardrails, instrument metrics.

If youâ€™d like, I can tailor this with your actual dates, hours, and the specific V1 workflow youâ€™re leaning toward.
