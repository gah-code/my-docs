## Slide 1: Title

**Rome’s Communication Design in the AI Era**
*Subtitle: Building Dynamic, AI-Driven Content Collaboration*

Rome's journey in content management is evolving rapidly, mirroring the advancements in technology and communication. Today, I want to discuss how we can rethink our communication design for the AI era, making it as dynamic as the tech we’re utilizing.

As our systems and data pipelines expand, the complexity of communication increases. To keep pace with AI advancements, we require a flexible approach that integrates seamlessly with our new data lake, which is crucial for creating real-time data streams.

Without a unified data lake, we can't fully leverage AI's potential. It enables faster data aggregation from various sources, allowing for personalized dashboards that facilitate better decision-making and collaboration across teams.

This data-driven foundation positions Rome to not only adapt to change but to lead with enhanced visibility and intelligence. Today, I’ll outline the step-by-step phases of this project, showcasing how we’re transforming our content intelligence and AI capabilities.

---

## Slide 2: The Evolving Landscape

* Rome’s content management and communication systems are rapidly expanding
* Increased complexity in data pipelines and team collaboration
* Need for a flexible, intelligent communication design aligned with AI advancements

**Speaker Note:**
“Rome’s journey in content management is evolving fast, and so must the ways our teams communicate. To keep pace with AI-driven changes, we need a design as dynamic and intelligent as the technology itself.”

---

## Slide 3: The Foundation: Unified Data Lake

* Without a centralized data lake, AI potential remains untapped
* Data lake enables rapid aggregation from multiple sources
* Personalized dashboards empower users to explore, analyze, and collaborate
* Accelerates decision-making and insight discovery

**Speaker Note:**
“A unified data lake is the bedrock for AI success. It accelerates data flow from diverse tools, allowing users to analyze and collaborate effectively through personalized dashboards.”

---

## Slide 4: Phase One — Centralized Intelligence Blueprint

* Design unified data collection from Slack, Quip, Box, AEM, Radar
* Build a secure, scalable data storage system (data lake)
* Define processing pipelines: cleanse, normalize, enrich metadata
* Integrate data streams into Tableau for real-time visualization
* Establish governance policies for security and compliance

**Speaker Note:**
“Our first phase focuses on designing a centralized intelligence blueprint, ensuring clean, secure, and enriched data flows into Tableau dashboards — the nerve center for insights.”

---

## Slide 5: Focus First — Dashboard Design Before Worksheets

* Prioritize dashboard goals and user experience
* Define key metrics and narrative
* Wireframe layout and interaction models
* Identify required data dimensions and sources
* Build worksheets only after blueprint finalization

**Speaker Note:**
“Effective dashboards start with design — not data sheets. Defining user goals, metrics, and interaction up front ensures a cohesive, intuitive experience.”

### How to Interpret

* **Data Sources** continuously send metadata to the centralized **Data Lake** for storage.
* **Processing Pipelines** clean, enrich, and tag data with user roles and contextual information based on MCP rules.
* **Data Modeling** creates tables and contextual views filtered dynamically to represent data relevant to each user.
* **Tableau Dashboards** consume this modeled data, offering interactive visualizations customized by user role and context.
* The **MCP Middleware Layer** acts as the control point, enforcing security, data visibility, and pushing event-driven updates or alerts.

### How Multi-Channel Publishing Works in Tableau & Integration

* **Report Generation:** Tableau schedules and generates monthly summary reports based on live data.
* **Slack Integration:** Publish report snapshots or links into designated Slack channels using Tableau’s Slack integration or webhook triggers.
* **Email Distribution:** Automatically email PDF or link to reports to managers and stakeholders.
* **Quip Publishing:** Upload or link report files into shared Quip folders for centralized access and historical record.
* **Automation Tools:** Use MCP-enabled workflows or automation platforms (e.g., Zapier, Integromat) to orchestrate simultaneous multi-channel delivery.

### Explanation

* **Ticketing System (X):** Contains ticket metadata including ID, status, priority, and assignee.
* **Document Platform (N):** Contains documents linked to tickets via a foreign key (`Related Ticket ID`).
* **Data Integration Layer:** Performs data joining, cleansing, and preparation either via ETL tools or Tableau’s native data blending.
* **Tableau Data Model:** Creates a unified logical data model that merges ticket and document data for reporting.
* **Dashboard:** Visualizes ticket progress alongside linked document references, enabling users to drill down and access contextual information seamlessly.

  `DATEDIFF('day', [Created Date], TODAY())`

* **Resolution Time**
  `DATEDIFF('day', [Created Date], [Resolved Date])`

* **Document Age**
  `DATEDIFF('day', [Last Modified Date], TODAY())`

* **Ticket Status Category**
  Group statuses into categories for filtering and visual clarity

* **Has Document**
  Boolean: `IF ISNULL([Document ID]) THEN FALSE ELSE TRUE END`

---

## 4. **Sheets / Visualizations**

* **Ticket Overview Sheet**

  * Bar chart: Count of Tickets by Status and Priority
  * KPI cards: Total Open Tickets, Average Resolution Time

* **Document Link Sheet**

  * Table or text table: List of Tickets with linked Documents (Title, Author, Last Modified)
  * Highlight tickets without any linked document (using Has Document field)

* **Timeline Sheet**

  * Gantt or line chart showing Ticket Creation and Resolution over time
  * Overlay Document Last Modified dates for contextual timing

* **Activity Heatmap**

* **Linked Panel:** Detail Table of Documents related to selected Ticket(s)
* **Timeline & Heatmap:** Visual context on activity trends
* **Action Buttons:** (If embedded with extensions)

  * Link to Ticket system URL for selected ticket
  * Link to Document platform URL for quick access

---

## 6. **Interactivity**

* Use **dashboard actions**:

  * Filter documents when a ticket is selected
  * Highlight tickets when hovering over documents

* **Parameter Controls** to select date ranges or priority levels

* **Role-based Views:**

  * Filters or separate dashboards for different user roles (Managers, Content Creators, QA)

---

## 7. **Integration & Automation**

* Connect Tableau data refresh to upstream ETL or APIs for up-to-date information
* Schedule **data extract refreshes** nightly or as needed
* Embed or share dashboards through collaboration tools like Slack or Quip for easy team access

### Implementation Outline

1. **Monitor Ticket State Changes:**

   * In your data processing pipeline or ticketing system webhook, detect when a ticket’s state changes.
   * Add logic to check if the new state equals “X.”

2. **Trigger Slack Notification:**

   * Use Slack API to send a message to the designated content management channel.
   * Example payload:

     ```json
     {
       "channel": "#content-operations",
       "text": "Ticket #1234 has entered State X — Operational communication required."
     }
     ```

3. **Continue Data Flow:**

   * Regardless of notification, update the ticket data in Tableau for visualization.

4. **Use Tableau Dashboard:**

   * Managers can see state changes and ticket flow visually, with Slack handling the real-time operational communication.

### Explanation

* The **Client App** (could be Slack, internal portal, or training platform) captures user queries and sends them with relevant user context (role, history) through the **MCP** interface.
* The **Internal LLM** ingests the context and query, referencing content model metadata, operational documentation, and training resources to produce accurate, contextual answers.
* The response sent back via MCP includes the direct answer, suggested further reading, and links to Quip documents or other internal knowledge bases.
* The client then presents the information interactively to the user.
* Users can ask follow-ups or provide feedback, enabling continuous dialog.

Great question! Here’s guidance for implementing the **MCP-based Training Assistant** with notes on **using Tableau Server** as part of the training portal ecosystem.

---

# Implementation Guidance: MCP-Based Training Assistant

## 1. Architecture Overview

* **Client App**: The user-facing training portal where content managers ask questions and receive answers.
  This **could be a custom web app, Slack bot, or even a Tableau Server embedded portal**.

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The data & context exchange protocol allowing the client to send queries with relevant metadata (user role, session info, query context) to the AI system and receive rich responses.

* **Internal LLM**: The AI engine hosted on-prem or securely in cloud, trained with your content models, operational docs, and other relevant corpora.

* **Knowledge Sources**: Content models (e.g., AEM metadata), operational documents (e.g., Quip docs), and training materials.

---

## 2. Using Tableau Server in the Training Portal

### Pros

* **Central Hub**: Tableau Server is already the unified intelligence platform for your org, so embedding training-related dashboards is natural.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: You can create dashboards with KPIs about training progress, FAQ usage, and link out to learning content.
* **Embedded Content**: Tableau supports embedding web content inside dashboards (via Web Page objects), which can host your MCP-based Q\&A UI or chatbot widget.
* **Access Control**: Leverage Tableau’s user authentication to control training content visibility by role.

### Cons / Considerations

* **Limited Conversational UI**: Tableau dashboards are primarily data visualization focused — you would need a separate UI (embedded web app or chatbot) to handle dynamic conversational queries.
* **Integration Complexity**: Combining live MCP-driven AI Q\&A with Tableau may require embedding external services or custom extensions.

---

## 3. Suggested Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Build MCP Q\&A Microservice

* Develop a backend microservice implementing MCP to receive queries + context, run them through the internal LLM, and return structured responses.

### Step 2: Create Frontend Q\&A Interface

* Web-based chatbot or Slack integration to allow users to submit questions and display AI-generated answers.
* Include links to relevant Quip docs or training content.

### Step 3: Embed in Tableau Server

* Use Tableau’s **Web Page** object or **Dashboard Extensions API** to embed your Q\&A interface inside a training dashboard.
* Combine with training progress visualizations and metrics (e.g., completion rates, popular FAQs).

### Step 4: Role-Based Personalization

* Pass Tableau user metadata (roles, groups) as context to the MCP query to tailor AI responses.
* Restrict dashboard and content visibility per user roles.

### Step 5: Analytics & Feedback Loop

* Track question types, user satisfaction, and content gaps.
* Use this data to refine AI training data and update training materials.

## 4. Summary

| Aspect              | Recommendation                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Conversational UI   | Build or integrate chatbot/web app for AI Q\&A               |
| Dashboard & Metrics | Use Tableau Server to display training KPIs & embed Q\&A UI  |
| Security & Roles    | Leverage Tableau’s auth for access control                   |
| Data Flow           | Use MCP for structured context exchange between client & LLM |

### Explanation

1. **Client**: The user (content manager, trainee, etc.) interacts via a UI such as a chatbot, Slack command, or web app, submitting a question or command enriched with context (role, current task, session data).

2. **MCP Server**: Acts as the API gateway that receives the query and structured metadata, enforcing security and routing the request to the appropriate AI model or service.

3. **Internal LLM Model**: Uses the metadata to understand the context, query relevant data sources, perform reasoning or summarization, and generate a helpful response.

4. **Knowledge & Data Sources**: Includes internal documentation (Quip), CMS metadata (AEM), asset repositories (Box), training materials, or other content stores the LLM queries to ground its answers.

5. **Response Flow**: The LLM crafts a response, possibly with links or references to original sources, which the MCP server returns to the client UI.

6. **User Display**: The user receives an intelligent, context-aware answer with relevant supporting content or next steps.
