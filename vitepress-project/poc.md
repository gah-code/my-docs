# Proof of Concept Draft: MCP-Based Training Assistant with AI & Unified Content Intelligence

## 1. Objective

Build a smart Training Assistant leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that uses an internal **Large Language Model (LLM)** to provide context-aware answers and resource recommendations related to content models, workflows, and operations. Integrate with enterprise content repositories and analytics tools (Quip, AEM, Box, Radar, Tableau) for data-driven training support.

## 2. Core Components

| Component          | Role / Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client UI**      | Slack bot, web chat, or web portal for users to query and receive help.          |
| **MCP Server**     | API gateway that manages request routing, security, and context sharing.         |
| **Internal LLM**   | AI engine for understanding queries, fetching data, and generating responses.    |
| **Data Sources**   | Quip docs, AEM content fragments, Box assets, Radar tickets, training materials. |
| **Tableau Server** | Dashboard portal providing analytics, training progress, and feedback.           |

## 3. Workflow Overview

### Step 1: User Query Submission

* User asks a question via Slack chatbot or web interface.
* Query includes metadata: user role, current project, session context.

### Step 2: MCP Server Receives & Routes

* MCP server authenticates user.
* Parses query and passes context + request to Internal LLM.

### Step 3: LLM Contextual Processing

* LLM interprets question with contextual metadata.
* Queries relevant data sources (Quip, AEM, Box, Radar).
* Synthesizes information and generates a summary or answer.

### Step 4: Response Delivery

* MCP server returns enriched response to client UI.
* Includes links to source documents, training resources, or action items.

### Step 5: Analytics & Feedback

* Interaction data logged into Tableau for training usage and improvement tracking.
* Managers view dashboards for adoption, question types, and knowledge gaps.

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

| Phase                                           | Description                                                                 | Deliverables                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1: Setup MCP Server & LLM Integration** | Deploy MCP API layer; integrate internal LLM with query interface.          | API endpoints, authentication setup |
| **Phase 2: Connect Data Sources**               | Configure connectors to Quip, AEM, Box, Radar, and training repos.          | Data APIs, metadata normalization   |
| **Phase 3: Client UI Development**              | Build Slack bot and/or web chat client; implement context passing.          | Slack commands, chat interface      |
| **Phase 4: Tableau Dashboard Setup**            | Create dashboards to monitor training interactions and insights.            | Usage metrics, feedback loops       |
| **Phase 5: Testing & Iteration**                | Pilot test with a group of content managers and trainees; collect feedback. | Bug fixes, UX improvements          |

---

## 5. Sample Use Case

* A new content manager asks: *“How do I link a Radar ticket to a Quip document?”*
* MCP server forwards the query to the LLM, which queries internal documentation.
* LLM generates a step-by-step guide with links to the relevant Quip docs.
* Response delivered instantly in Slack with embedded links and suggested training videos.
* Manager usage tracked and surfaced in Tableau to identify training needs.

## 6. Success Metrics

| Metric                   | Target / KPI                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| User Query Response Time | < 5 seconds                               |
| Accuracy of AI Responses | > 85% correct and actionable responses    |
| User Adoption Rate       | 80% of new hires actively use assistant   |
| Knowledge Gap Reduction  | 30% decrease in repeated common questions |
| Training Completion Rate | > 90% within 60 days                      |

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                         | Mitigation Strategy                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Privacy & Security      | Enforce strict authentication and role-based access via MCP.       |
| AI Misinterpretation         | Maintain human oversight, feedback loop for continuous LLM tuning. |
| Data Integration Complexity  | Start with prioritized sources, use normalized metadata formats.   |
| User Resistance to New Tools | Provide training and embed usage into daily workflows.             |

---

## 8. Next Steps

* Confirm scope and priorities with stakeholders.
* Assemble technical and content teams.
* Begin Phase 1 MCP server deployment and LLM integration.
* Schedule initial pilot and evaluation period.
