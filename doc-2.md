Absolutely—here’s your **manager‑facing**, confident sprint report grouped into a reusable `Sprint_Report_Week_01.md` template, **without any Week 3 content** and explicitly noting the **pivot to a RAG bot before MCP** due to LLM API key complications.

I also saved it as a ready‑to‑share Markdown file:

# Sprint 01 Report (Weeks 1–2) — Internal AI Tool Development

**Prepared for:** Product • Engineering • Program Management
**Sprint Theme:** LLM Integration, Security Readiness & Environment Setup
**Status:** ✅ **Green** — momentum restored after early environment blocks; risks logged and mitigations in place.

---

## Executive Summary (Manager View)

* We established a **secure, reproducible dev environment** (VS Code + terminal) standardized on **uv** and **zsh** with approved API token handling.
* After testing multiple internal LLM integration paths (Claude, Quip API, Radar), we **selected Claude code tooling** as the most stable and policy-aligned starting point.
* To avoid schedule friction from **LLM API key complications** tied to MCP adoption, we made a **decisive interim pivot to a RAG bot**. This keeps delivery on track, de-risks key management, and accelerates value generation while MCP access stabilizes.

---

## Sprint Goals

1. Establish a secure and compliant development environment.
2. Identify and test internal LLM tooling (Claude, Quip API, Radar).
3. Document early barriers and streamline the path toward a prototype.

---

## Week 1 — Ecosystem Orientation & Secure Foundations

### Objectives

* Audit internal tools, LLM platforms, and documentation.
* Identify tooling that meets internal security/IP compliance standards.
* Begin authentication configuration and terminal-level access testing.

### Work Completed

* Navigated internal APIs and LLM integration points (**Claude, Quip, Radar**).
* Successfully initiated **terminal-based data pulls** using secure tokens.
* Audited internal repos and policy documentation for platform guardrails.
* **Selected Claude code tooling** as the most stable, production-friendly option.

### Management-Visible Pain Points

| Area                             | Pain Point                                                                                                      | Business Impact                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ecosystem Onboarding**         | No single source of truth across repos, Slack threads, and LLM docs.                                            | Extended ramp-up time (\~3–5 days). Context switching between platforms.  |
| **Security & Authorization**     | Initial auth flow for LLMs (e.g., token injection for Claude) required multi-team coordination and trial/error. | Slowed early development; fragile paths could fail silently.              |
| **Unopinionated Infrastructure** | Too many starting points; unclear preferred/supported tools.                                                    | Delayed decisions; risk of building on unsupported paths.                 |
| **Tooling Trust**                | VS Code extensions (Claude vs. Anthropic) behaved inconsistently.                                               | Productivity blocked until a single secure, reproducible path was chosen. |

## Week 2 — Dev Tooling Pivot & Early Prototyping

### Objectives

* Secure and stabilize the local development setup using best practices.
* Transition to **uv** for package management.
* Test Claude for secure metadata extraction and internal queries.

### Work Completed

* Reconfigured Python environment and `.zshrc` for compatibility with **uv**.
* Debugged environment edge cases across VS Code terminal and CLI.
* Used **Claude** to securely generate synthetic metadata and extract info from **Quip** notes.
* Received positive internal feedback from Slack and hackathon advisors.

### Additional Pain Points

| Area                              | Pain Point                                                                       | Business Impact                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package Management Transition** | Pivot from `pip` to **uv** required re-learning virtualenv management.           | Cost \~1–2 days in environment rework; reduces long‑term dependency risk.       |
| **VS Code Extension Behavior**    | Confusion between Claude vs. Anthropic extensions caused unpredictable behavior. | Delayed coding progress; “invisible errors” until terminal testing was adopted. |
| **Lack of Standard API Logging**  | No default telemetry/feedback on failed API calls.                               | Increased debugging time; reliance on tribal knowledge/Slack fixes.             |

## Sprint Outcomes

* ✅ **Claude code selected** as primary LLM tooling for secure, policy-compliant workflows.
* ✅ **Dev environment stabilized** (VS Code + terminal) with **uv + zsh** and secure API setup.
* ✅ **API authorization tested** for **Quip, Radar, Claude** endpoints using sample data.
* ✅ **LLM-based prototyping started**: metadata extraction and ML-layer exploration.
* ✅ **Key blockers surfaced and documented** for future onboarding efficiency.

## Interim Pivot (Decision): Build RAG Bot **before** MCP Framework

**Why now:** MCP adoption is gated by **LLM API key complications**. A targeted **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** bot lets us deliver user-facing value immediately without waiting on MCP keying and policy stabilization.

**Scope (2–3 workstreams in parallel):**

1. **Data access layer**: Read-only connectors (e.g., Quip, Radar) with approved token patterns.
2. **Indexing & retrieval**: Lightweight vector store + guardrails (namespace separation, PII-aware filters).
3. **Inference**: Claude-backed Q\&A with strict prompt scaffolding and response provenance (source links).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Given a set of Quip pages and Radar notes, the bot answers scoped questions with **citations and confidence hints**.
* All data access via **read-only tokens**, stored and rotated per policy.
* **Zero local data exfiltration**; logs capture request/response metadata (no sensitive payloads).

**Dependencies & Risk Controls:**

* Pending: standardized **API logging** and error taxonomy.
* Token lifecycle documented in `setup_dev_env.md`; rotation path validated.
* Clear fallback: disable retrieval per-namespace if policy flags are raised.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Auth fragility / silent failures** → Enforce terminal-first testing, add retry/backoff, and minimal health checks for each API call.
* **Extension inconsistency** → Standardize on **Claude code tooling**; document known-good VS Code settings.
* **Knowledge sprawl** → Create a single “Source of Truth” page that indexes repos, policies, and runbooks; keep it evergreen via weekly review.
* **Key management dependencies** → Maintain the **RAG-first** path until MCP keying is stable; plan a controlled handover.

---

## Asks / Decisions Needed (from Management)

1. **Endorse the RAG-first pivot** until MCP key issues are resolved.
2. Approve **uv** as the default package manager for this project.
3. Green-light a **basic API logging standard** (request outcome, latency, error class) for LLM/Quip/Radar calls.
4. Nominate an owner for the **Source of Truth** page and agree on a weekly update cadence.
